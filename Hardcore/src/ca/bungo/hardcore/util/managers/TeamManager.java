	 * 
	 * Only team members will be allowed to Teleport to each other
	 * 
	 * If admins discover players working together constantly
	 * 	(Outside of trading / small assists)
	 * Players will be warnned, kicked, and in worse case banned for not using a team.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Why enforce a team system?
	 * 	Players who are on the same team CANNOT claim Kill Bounties on their team mates.
	 * 	This is to avoid players using exploitable methods to quickly level up them selves or their friends
	 * 	and to keep players from removing their XP Bounty Punishment caused by killing too many players
